**Short description of project :**   A novel approach has been developed to implement the popular k-means clustering in the presence of extreme class imbalance. After clustering into 3 groups (fibrosis, myocytes and fat), the slice-wise distribution of these tissue types throughout the 3D stack is analysed. Significant regions are located from the bumps in the plotly graph. These sites are used for further analysis. Additionally, the proportion of tissue types in the selected slice is compared with the regional and overall proportions. See the "Implememtation details" tab in the app for more info.

This folder contains the code corresponding to an R Shiny app created during my PhD. The app shows the data, methods and results of a color based clustering strategy developed to address the class imbalance problem.

**Short description of project :**   A novel approach has been developed to implement the popular k-means clustering in the presence of extreme class imbalance. After clustering all the slices in a 3D stack of images into 3 groups (fibrosis, myocytes and fat), the slice-wise distribution of these tissue types is analysed. Significant regions are located from the bumps in the plotly graph. These sites are then used for further analysis. Additionally, the proportion of tissue types in the selected slice is compared with the regional and overall proportions. See the "Implememtation details" tab in the app for more info.

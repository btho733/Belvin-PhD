Short description of project :   A novel approach is developed to implement the popular k-means clustering in the presence of extreme class imbalance. The slice-wise distribution of 3 tissue types are analysed and significant regions are located from the bumps in the plotly graph. Additionally, the proportion of tissue types in the selected slice is compared relative to the regional and overall proportions. See the 'Implememtation details' tab in the app for more info.
